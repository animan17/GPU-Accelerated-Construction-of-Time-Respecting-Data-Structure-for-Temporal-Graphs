# GPU Accelerated Construction of Time Respecting Data Structure for Temporal Graphs

- A novel GPU-based Parallel Algorithm to construct Time-Respecting Data Structure for Temporal Graphs. 
- It is implemented using CUDA C for NVIDIA GPUs, and we have achieved up to 139x speedup over existing sequential variants.
- Paper ready for submission in upcoming HPC conferences (Aug-Oct 2024)
